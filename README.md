# *YPS-1821 : Open Containers on IBM Power Systems* lab at IBM Interconnect 2016 at Las Vegas #

These are the scripts that will handle the Open Container lab. 

This lab will take place on *Mon, 22-Feb, 10:30 AM-11:30 AM* at room **319** (MGM)

## Agenda ##

 1. **Intro, Setup and machine access**  *(10 minutes)*
	1. Expectation: Everyone has access to the virtual machine
 2. **Docker principles** *(10 minutes)*
	1. Understand and run the container management scripts at
	   /containers/cloud/docker/launch 
	1. Create a new Docker image using a Docker file
 3. **LXD principles**  *(10 minutes)*
	1. Understand the LXD commands and how to handle a container image
 4. **LXC principles**  *(10 minutes)*
	1. Learn how to handle a LXC container
	2. Understands how a new image could be created using debootstrap
 5. **Q&A** *(20 minutes)*
 6. Continue to play with the VMs, the IPs are public.
	1. If you have any question, get in touch with the Container
	   specialists at the Container ped
	

## Technologies ##

This tutorial will cover 3 container technologies on Linux on Power.

 * **Docker**
	- Docker is an open source tool that added image handling on top of
	  Linux containers.

 * **LXC**
	- LXC is the well known set of tools, templates, library and language
	  bindings. It's pretty low level, very flexible and covers just about
   	  every containment feature supported by the upstream kernel

 * **LXD**
	- LXD, called *lex‚Äêdee*, is a container "hypervisor" and a new user
	  experience for LXC.
	  LXD is built on top of LXC to provide a new, better user experience.

This lab will show how to create, start and handle a container using these
three different technologies.

## Images ##

In order to cover also image handling, this lab will also use three different
ways to get a container image, and how to customize an image on Docker:

 * **Docker**
	- Download an image already built and ready from the official [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com)
	- Customize an downloaded image. Change the cowsay(1) image.
	- If you want to push your image to the official Dockerhub registry, you
	  will need to register at https://hub.docker.com/register/
	
 * **LXC**
	- Download an image already built and ready from [Linux Containers website](https://linuxcontainers.org)

 * **LXD**
	- Create a Linux image directly from a apt repository using
	  debootstrap(1) command:
	  Debootstrap basically get the .deb packages from an archive and
	  extract them so they can create a basic and functional rootfs

## Scripts structure ##

The two major directories contains the same scripts, one to run at VCaaS cloud
images, and another one in a single machine in Brazil.

## Privileges ##

Almost all these commands could be run with unprivileged users, although,
debootstrap(1) command needs a sudo privilege, meaning that the LXD example
will be used with sudo.

## Virtual Machines ##

These machines are provided as part of a Technology Preview of a Virtual
Machine Service running on POWER8 in SoftLayer. They have a PED in the Solution
EXPO if anyone is interested in learning more. The PED will be in the Systems -
Power Area.
